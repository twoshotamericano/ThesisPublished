Visualising the data geospatially gives additional insights. In Figure \@ref(fig:Geo1), we see that our model from the previous [section](#Visualisations) does not capture clusters of low value (dark blue) and high value properties (light purple). Here is the formula of the model used for prediction in Figure \@ref(fig:Geo1):

```{r,echo=FALSE}
formula(fitg2)
```

(ref:Geo1) Fitting a model only on attributes of the property (eg. number of bedrooms) fails to predict all clusters of low value and high value properties. 

```{r Geo1,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo1)',fig.align='center',dpi=20}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoActualPredict.png")
```


If for each property in our data-set we add attributes of the neighbourhood, these explanatory variables allow us to model clusters more accurately. In Figure \@ref(fig:Geo2), the scales are slightly different but the cluster of high value properties (light purple) in the middle of the chart are predicted more accurately.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
formula(fitg1)
```


(ref:Geo2) Fitting a model with property attributes & neighbourhood attributes as explanatory variables predicts some clusters better (eg. proximity of schools) . 

```{r Geo2,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo2)',fig.align='center',dpi=40}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPredictUpdate.png")
```


The explanation for what is going on is that we are failing to take account of how nice the neighbourhood is (eg. proximity to schools) when we only have attributes of a property as explanatory variables (eg. number of bedrooms).

For a statistical comparison of the prediction models in Figures \@ref(fig:Geo1) and \@ref(fig:Geo2) please see the end of this section.


**Locational Data**

In R, I used API calls to scrape data from the Google Maps and Zillow property websites. For each of the 21000 properties in the data-set, this involved passing the latitude and longitude co-ordinates to the website and receiving detailed neighbourhood data back. 

The plots below show the data fields obtained in this way. The plots were created using the sp package in R. It is clear that some neighbourhood properties change significantly by location (eg. number of schools in 1000m). There are also variables which hardly change at all (eg. Number of Liquor Stores).

(ref:Geo3) Number of Schools within 1000m by Location

```{r Geo3,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo3)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotSchools1000m.png")
```

(ref:Geo4) Number of Doctors or Dentists within 500m by Location

```{r Geo4,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotDocDent500.png")
```

(ref:Geo5) Number of Grocery Stores or Supermarkets within 1000m by Location

```{r Geo5,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotGroceries1000m.png")
```

(ref:Geo6) Number of Libraries within 750m by Location

```{r Geo6,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotLibraries750m.png")
```

(ref:Geo7) Number of Liquor Stores within 250m by Location

```{r Geo7,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotLiquor.png")
```

(ref:Geo8) Number of Restaurants within 250m by Location

```{r Geo8,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotRest250m.png")
```

(ref:Geo9) Bus or Transit Station within 100m by Location

```{r Geo9,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoBusTransit100m.png")
```

(ref:Geo10) Number of Department Stores of Malls withing 750m by Location

```{r Geo10,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoMallDepartment.png")
```

(ref:Geo11) Average Monthly Rental Value by Location

```{r Geo11,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoRental1.png")
```

(ref:Geo15) Number of Police Stations within 1000m

```{r Geo15,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotPoliceStations1000m.png")
```


**Other Data**

It is suprising to find spatial patterns when we plot property specific variables (eg. Construction Year) by location. For example with Construction Year, the oldest properties are located in the north-west region and properties get progressively newer as we move east.

(ref:Geo12) Plot of Property Construction Year by Location

```{r Geo12,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotConstructionYr.png")
```

(ref:Geo13) Plot of Number of Floors by Location

```{r Geo13,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotFloorNo.png")
```

(ref:Geo14) Plot of Number of Bedrooms by Location

```{r Geo14,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Geo4)',fig.align='center',dpi=60}
knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/GeoPlotBedrooms.png")
```


**Statistics**

For completeness, lets compare the model fitted with and without locational data.

```{r GeoModelChecking, echo=FALSE}
#Analysis of Variabe

a<-anova(fitg2,fitg1)

b<-data.frame(Model=c("NonGeoModel","GeoModel"),
              DoF=a$Res.Df,
              RSS=round(a$RSS,0),
              "DOF_Diff"=a$Df,
              SUmOfSq=a$`Sum of Sq`,
              FProb=round(a$`Pr(>F)`,2))

table2<-xtable(b,
               caption="Statistical Test with & without Geospatial Data")


```

```{r GeoPrintTable, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, results='asis'}
options("xtable.type"="html")

print.xtable(table2,caption.placement="bottom")

htmlreg(list(fitg1,fitg2),
       caption='Parameter Comparison: Model1 is with GeoSpatial Data',
       caption.above=TRUE)



```
