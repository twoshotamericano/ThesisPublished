# Conclusions

This thesis is about Data Analytics in Business. A key challenge being to empower colleagues to engage with Data Analytics themselves (and not leave it to the nerds in the corner)! 

I have presented R Studio as a next generation Analytics tool. In Section 1, we worked through an example of how R Studio allows you to do so much more!! You saw an interactive Shiny model and some advanced visualisations. In Section 2, we looked in more detail at the R Studio system and the economic rationale for embracing it.

To end where we started: **How** can we empower our colleagues to embrace Data Analytics? **How** can we enable our colleagues to solve their own Data Problems? **Why** is this an economically sensible approach? 

*Use the R Studio system as the enabling technology because it allows Mass Customisation, 3D printing for Data Projects*
