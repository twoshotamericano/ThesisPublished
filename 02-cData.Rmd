# Original Data {#Data}

I am interested in applying multivariate analysis to understand the factors affecting property prices. To do this, I sourced  a property data-set from the website @kaggle1. The original data-set contains sale prices and property details for 21613 residential property transactions between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County USA (includes Seattle). 

In the [Data Source](#OriginalData) sub-section I discuss the Original Data set and conduct an in-depth exploratory analysis using a range of visualisations. Detecting Outliers and Errors is discussed in the [Outliers and Errors](#ErrorsOriginalData) sub-section. Multivariate techniques such as a **Principal Component Decomposition** and a **Multivariate Clustering Technique** are applied. The Original Data section closes with a novel use of **Factor Analysis** to investigate hidden relationships in the data. 


## Data Source {#OriginalData}

The original data can be found on my GitHub site ([Source Data](ThesisPublished/Analysis/Data/kc_house_data.csv)). The data comprises a table with 21613 rows (one per property sale) and 19 columns of explanatory variables. Descriptions of each data column is shown below. The fields containing categorical data as opposed to numeric (discrete or continuous) are also identified. The absence of information for a particular property, in a particular field was encoded with a blank.

**Exploratory Analysis**

For large, multivariate data sets it takes more time to search through and explore a data set. The plots below allow a quick inspection of the original data-set. 

Whilst Visual inspection of the data table is tedious and unreliable, through sorting property ID's, I was able to identify that a small number of properties appear multiple times in the data. This comes about due to a single property being sold more than once during within the data collection period. For my analysis, I chose to retain only the most recent transactional record for properties with multiple appearances. This process reduced the size of the data-table from 21613 to 21436 rows.

In figure \@ref(fig:Outliers1), we that the largest 6% of all sale transactions by number, account for 18% of the total transactional value in the data. Furthermore, as can be seen  this group of properties outlies the other property values.

```

In figure \@ref(fig:DataExploration0), we see a large spread in the sizes of living spaces and a significant portion of properties without basements. In the lot size chart, we see again a large spread of sizes with a significant upper tail.

```

In figure \@ref(fig:DataExploration2), we see that the modal number of bedrooms is three and the modal number of bathrooms is 2. There are 13 and 85 properties with no bedrooms or no bathrooms respectively. These are understood to be data entry errors are are excluded from the analysis data sets. There is also one mid-value property in the data with 33 bedrooms, this should also be excluded as an error.

```


In figure \@ref(fig:DataExploration3), we see that the vast majority of the properties in the data-set do not have a waterfront view. This is surprising given the presence of significant lakes near to Seattle. We do see in figure \@ref(fig:DataExploration4), that a significant minority of properties do have a general view. It is possible that the low number of waterfront view properties is due to a very restrictive criteria set being applied (eg. property must be next to water for a waterfront view flag). The vast majority of the properties in the data are either single storey appartments or bungalows (10559) or two storey maisonettes (8209).

```{r DataExploration3,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:DataExploration3)',fig.align='center'}

```

In figure \@ref(fig:DataExploration4), we see that a significant minority of the properties in the data-set (approx 10%) have a view on at least one side
There are only 193 properties in the data-set in poor condition (ie. condition less than 2). Visual inspection of these records, shows that they were built in the early 20th century and may have become dilapidated.

```{r DataExploration4,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:DataExploration4)',fig.align='center'}

```

In figure \@ref(fig:DataExploration5), we see that the vast majority of properties were built in late 20th century and early 21st century. The earliest construction date in the data is 1900.The grade metric is another measure of property condition. As it has a wider range of values than "condition", it looks like a better differentiator of properties in good and bad states of repair.

## Outliers and Errors {#ErrorsOriginalData}

For large, multivariate data sets it is harder to search for individual outliers and errors. Visual inspection of the data table is tedious and unreliable. Through sorting the property ID's, I was able to identify that a small number of properties appears multiple times in the data. This comes about due to a single property being sold more than once during within the data collection period. For my analysis, I chose to retain only the most recent transactional record for properties with multiple appearances. This process reduced the size of the data-table from 21613 to 21436 rows.

Whilst the interdependencies between variables renders "one-at-a-time" approaches that focus on marginal distributions unreliable. Through plotting marginal distributions, I was able to identify that the largest 6% of all sale transactions by number, account for 18% of the total transactional value in the data. Furthermore, as can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:Outliers1), this group of properties outlies the other property values.


***Multivariate Analysis***

Powerful statistical techniques exist for detecting outliers in data generated by Multivariate normal distributions. Individual variables, when standardised, should follow the $t_{n-1}$ distribution. The generalised distance $(x_{j}-\overline{x})^Â´S^{-1}(x_{j}-\overline{x})$  of each vector of observations  $\underset{(p \times 1)}{x_{j}}$ from the sample mean $\overline{x}$ is approximately $\chi_{p-1}^2$ distributed. This means that, in addition to univariate and bivariate scatter plots, we can numerically identify outliers as points corresponding to very low or very high significance levels (see @johnson2014applied, Chapter 4, page 189).

By transforming the data first to standardised co-ordinates and then secondly to a principal component decomposition, I aimed to achieve approximate multivariate normality. I used the prcomp function in the stats package to obtain the principal components. The first five principal components account for 80% of the Sample Variation in the data. As a check I have plotted the eigenvalues of the Sample Covariance Matrix in fig \@ref(fig:OutliersPCA1) below. The steep slope in this Scree plot is consistent with the Variance in the data being captured in a few coordinates:

(ref:OutliersPCA1) The eigenvalues of the 10 eigenvectors of the Sample Covariance Matrix are plotted.

```{r OutliersPCA1,echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:OutliersPCA1)',fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("Analysis/Images/Scree.png")


```


The co-ordinates of the first 5 eigenvectors are shown in the summary table below. The first principal component (PC1) has positive components for almost all variables and places most weight on the number of bathrooms, the size of the living space, the price and the number of bedrooms. I interpret this principal component as a Market Index, measuring the base-line value of a property. 

The second principal component (PC2) contrasts properties with scarce features in the data versus those with common features. High Property price, Condition, View or Waterfront are given large negative weight. Year Built and Floors have large positive weight. In this manner I interpret the second Principal Component as being a Scarcity/Uniqueness Index.

}

```

The bivariate scatter plots of the first five principal components are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:OutliersPCA3). By inspection of the many scattered points towards the top of the first row of charts, it is clear many properties have unusually high values for PC1. This is consistent with the upper-tail of high priced properties in figure \@ref(fig:Outliers1) and I flagged all points with PC1 values above 10.5 as outliers.

In the second row of charts in Figure \@ref(fig:OutliersPCA3), there is a distinct cluster of points away from the main data cloud. This cluster of points is characterised by very low values for the Second Principal Component (PC2). I flagged all points with PC2 values below -6 as outliers, treating very high values for the "uniqueness" index similarly to very values for the "Market" Index PC1.


(ref:OutliersPCA3) Bivariate plots of the PCA coordinate values. The distinct groups visible in all plots involving Principal Component 3 are due to discreteness in the data.

```


The procedure above removed 151 outliers points. Correspondingly, the bivariate scatter plots in figure \@ref(fig:OutliersPCA3) begin to resemble the smooth ellipses expected of Multivariate Normal Data.

```


If the multivariate normal assumption were appropriate and p=10, we would expect 5% of observations to have a generalised distance above 16.92. In fact in this data set 16% of observations lie above this.

We begin to understand why this has occurred by applying a Clustering Algorithm. The scatter plots in Figure \@ref(fig:OutliersPCA5) were generated using using the mcclust package in R to fit a Mixture of Normal Distributions . The BIC criteria Value is significantly higher for a mixture of three (Equal Covariance) Multivariate Normal Distributions than for a single distribution.It is this heterogeneity in the data which makes the scatter plots in Figure \@ref(fig:OutliersPCA3) more disparate than otherwise.

Since according to Figure \@ref(fig:OutliersPCA5), outliers would still lie far from the centre of the data cloud, I used the 1% critical value of the $\chi_{9}^2$ distribution to flag the outermost data points as outliers. In this manner 563 additional data points (2.6% data) were flagged as outlying.
